      <div class = "boxa blurb">
        <p class="rp">As a physics major at Cornell University, I am deeply intrigued by how the world works. I love learning about the building blocks of all matter: the subatomic particles. Subsequently, I have participated in research to fuel my curiosity about the world. I also harbor a passion for graphic design that started when I was young. I enjoy designing for people and seeing how humans interact with design and plan on pursuing an information science minor.</p>
